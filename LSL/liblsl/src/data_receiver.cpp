* @param max_chunklen Optionally the maximum size, in samples, at which chunks are transmitted (the default corresponds to the chunk sizes used by the sender).
*					  Recording applications can use a generous size here (leaving it to the network how to pack things), while real-time applications may want a finer (perhaps 1-sample) granularity.
