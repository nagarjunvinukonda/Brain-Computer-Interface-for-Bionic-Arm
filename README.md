# Brain-Computer-Interface-for-Bionic-Arm
Created an Integrated system that collects brain waves and actuates Openbioic brunel hand

Neuro-prosthetics is a trending study for rehabilitation, substitution of limbs, mobility, cognition, hearing, vision and many other applications. 
My aim of this research is to create a BCI technology to enable sever motor impairment patients controlling prosthetics. 
The objective is to express the novelty of implementing a simple brain-computer Interface (BCI) system for prosthetic arm. 
This study uses SSVEP (Steady state Visually Evoked Potential) Method to read EEG data, MATLAB and Openvibe softwares for signal processing and control of Open bionics Brunel hand.

The following is the overview how I created this softwrae package:
